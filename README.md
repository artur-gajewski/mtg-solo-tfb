# Magic: The Gathering - Thirst For Battle
#### Yet Another Solo variant
#

##### Background:

This solo variant was designed to enable player to play Magic: The Gathering alone in the way it resembles two-player mode as closely as possible. The following rules are there to make sure player can not cheat, but ultimately the imaginary opponent is dumb and follows the rules despite possibly being more convenient for you.

##### Basics:

- Use Duel Deck or obtain two decks to play the solo variant. You and your imaginary opponent both use own decks to play.

- Deal a hand for yourself and your imaginary opponent, 7 cards for both. Place your opponent's cards side by side face up on his side of the table. Do NOT change the order of the cards!

- For your opponent, if there is no 1 land and 1 mana card present OR 2 lands and at least one 2 mana card, put those cards back, re-shuffle and draw another 7 cards and repeat as long as one of these conditions pass. No regular mulligan rules are enforced for the opponent's first hand re-shuffles.

- If you don't like your hand, regular mulligan rules ARE in effect for you only.

- Each turn is played with regular Magic The Gathering rules, but for your imaginary opponent, play his deck as described below.

##### Opponent's way of playing:

- When a land is drawn, it has to be played into the battlefield as it says on the card.

- If the drawn card is instant or sourcery, opponent pays the mana cost if able and cast it. If not enough mana, card is moved to the hand as the last card.

- When a spell is cast, place it on the battlefield as the last one in the row.

- The spell with less converted mana cost in the opponent's hand always has priority, meaning it is played first from the opponent's hand to the battlefield. If a spell in a hand has enough mana to be cast, it has to be played.

- If there are two cards with equal converted mana cost in the opponent's hand, the one on the left has priority and is played first.

- All creatures on the battlefield attack during opponent's main phase if they are not tapped or if they have not been cast in current turn.

- During your attack, your imaginary opponent always blocks with it's best available blocker first. Use toughness to select it's blocker. If there is a tie, the card on the left does the blocking.

- At the end of turn, gaps in the opponent's battlefield row (from removed cards) need to be fixed by sliding cards to the left without changing the order. New spells on the next turn are cast to the right side of the opponent's battlefield row.

- At the end of turn, if opponent has more than 7 cards in his had, discard the card with the most converted mana cost. If there is a tie between two card, discard the one on the left.
